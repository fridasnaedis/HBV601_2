Lil bill is your go to transaction management service!

To run this project clone or download the repository.


## Current state of project: 

On opening the app a login screen is presented. Login requires a valid username. The password does not matter. Valid usernames are listed in the backend readme.

After Login you see a list of all accounts owned by the user. clicking an account brings up a list of all transactions contained within the account. 
The list consists of an amount and date. with a description if you click on the transaction. In this activity you are also able to create a new transaction by clicking on the + button in the lower right corner. 
There, you can enter an amount and a description for the transaction and choose which friends to split between. The transaction will then appear in the list corresponding to the account it will belong to.

To add a new friend you can click the + friend icon in the top right corner. There you can type in a name. This name must exist as a username in the database otherwise you cannot add them to your friendslist.
